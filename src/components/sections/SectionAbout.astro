        At the center of Dublin, the Irish Capital of Texas, stands the Dublin
        Corner Lot. We are a small community park well equipped to please the
        senses of anyone passing by or choosing to stay a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thereâ€™s a charming gazebo, wooden benches shaded by arbors of
        crossvines, a small pond complete with bubbling waterfall, lovely
        waterlilies, and a school of koi (fish). Shade trees with flowers and
        even bluebonnets in spring wildflower season! This park is our front
        porch to the community.
