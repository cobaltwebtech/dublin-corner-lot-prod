        In 1975, there was a fire that destroyed a local favorite eatery,
        Black’s Cafe, along with several other businesses located along Patrick
        Street. Year after year the absentee owner did nothing and Dublin
        citizens had finally had enough of the dismal state of the space.

        1995 is the year the idea for this park was birthed. This plot of land
        in the center of town had remained barren, ugly, and neglected for over
        twenty years. Two women, owners of local businesses, planted a tiny
        garden on the very corner just to make the statement, “This is gonna
        change!”

      Citizens rallied, plans were made, trucks hauled off debris, and hauled in
      Erath County fertilizer aka "cow poop." The newly formed Corner Lot Gang
      kept the project moving. Citizens and local businesses donated labor,
      supplies, ideas, plants, and equipment. It was truly a community effort!
      Locals provided entertainment on site for Tuesday Night Under the Stars to
      raise funds.

      After an enormous city-wide garage sale under a big circus tent, the
      purchase price was still out of reach! That's when Billy Kloster, then the
      owner of Dublin Dr Pepper, came to the rescue. He donated $15,000 in
      exchange for the right to build a swinging Peggy Pepper sign on the Corner
      Lot. Billy had long dreamed of putting up that sign. Then he challenged a
      former DHS classmate, Gordon Hollon, to donate the final $5000 to complete
      the purchase price. Gordon eagerly agreed. In honor of Billy Kloster's
      generous donation and his dream, there's a plaque officially naming this
      spot Pretty Peggy Pepper Park.
