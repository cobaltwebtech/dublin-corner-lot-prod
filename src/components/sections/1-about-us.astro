        At the center of Dublin, the Irish Capital of Texas, stands the Dublin Corner Lot. We are a small community park well equipped to please the senses of anyone passing by or choosing to stay a bit.
      </p>
      <p class="max-w-4xl text-justify">
        Thereâ€™s a charming gazebo, wooden benches shaded by arbors of crossvines, a small pond complete with bubbling waterfall, lovely waterlilies, and a school of koi (fish). Shade trees with flowers and even bluebonnets in spring wildflower season! This park is our front porch to the community.
