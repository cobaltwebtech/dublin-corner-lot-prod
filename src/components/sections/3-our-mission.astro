        Our park does not belong to the city or any business. It belongs to those who support our cause of a green space for all.  Dublinâ€™s citizens, businesses, and friends have been committed to our mission since 1996 in helping to maintain this park. Support through memberships, donations, and memorials keeps it flourishing.

        Like any non-profit organization our funding comes completely from charitable donations to keep our park maintained and open to all. If you have a love of natural green spaces, keeping your community clean, and a passion for parks then consider making a donation today. We are a 501 (c)(3) non-profit organziation and all charitable donations are completely tax deductible. 
      </p>
      <p class="max-w-4xl text-justify">
        Can't make a donation? That's okay, we can still use your help by getting involved. We have "clean up" days, decoration events, general maintenance needs, and other areas where we could use an extra pair of hands to help. Get involved today in helping maintain the Corner Lot!
