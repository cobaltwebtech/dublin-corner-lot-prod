      Donate to the Dublin Corner Lot
    </h1>
    <p>
      Our park does not belong to the city or any business. It belongs to those
      who support our cause of a green space for all. Dublinâ€™s citizens,
      businesses, and friends have been committed to our mission since 1996 in
      helping to maintain this park. Support through memberships, donations, and
      memorials keeps it flourishing.
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-accent text-center text-3xl font-black">
      We Need Your Help!
    </h3>
    <p>
      Like any non-profit organization our funding comes completely from
      charitable donations to keep our park maintained and open to all. If you
      have a love of natural green spaces, keeping your community clean, and a
      passion for parks then consider making a donation today. We are a 501
      (c)(3) non-profit organziation and all charitable donations are completely
      tax deductible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can't make a donation? That's okay, we can still use your help by getting
      involved. We have "clean up" days, decoration events, general maintenance
      needs, and other areas where we could use an extra pair of hands to help.
      Get involved today in helping maintain the Corner Lot!
